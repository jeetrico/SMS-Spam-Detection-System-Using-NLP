# **SMS Spam Detection System Using NLP (P1)**  
üöÄ A Project by **Jeet Banerjee** üöÄ

---

## **üìñ Overview**  
This project implements a machine learning system for detecting spam SMS messages using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. It classifies messages as either **Spam** (unwanted advertisements, malicious content) or **Ham** (legitimate messages).

---

## **üîß Technologies Used**  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas**  
- **Scikit-learn**  
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **Seaborn**  
- **Joblib** (for model persistence)  
- **Imbalanced-learn** (to handle class imbalances)

---

## **üìã Project Workflow**  
1. **Data Collection:**  
   Used the **SMS Spam Collection** dataset, containing thousands of labeled SMS messages (spam or ham).  
   
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**  
   - Handled encoding issues (UTF-8, Latin-1).  
   - Removed duplicates and null values.  
   - Preprocessed text by removing special characters and unnecessary columns.

3. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Extracted text statistics: word count, character count.  
   - Used **TF-IDF Vectorization** to represent the importance of words.  

4. **Model Selection:**  
   - Trained multiple models and finalized **Multinomial Naive Bayes** for its superior accuracy and high precision.  

5. **Performance Metrics:**  
   - **Accuracy:** 97%  
   - **Precision:** 83%  
   - **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)** was used to handle class imbalance.

## **üöÄ How to Use the Model**  

### **1. Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jeetrico/SMS-Spam-Detection-System-Using-NLP.git
cd SMS-Spam-Detection-System-Using-NLP
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3. Run the Code**  
```bash
python SMS_SPAM_DETECTION.ipynb
```

## **üí° Using the Model in New Projects**  
Here's a quick start for reusing the model:  

```python
from joblib import load
import nltk
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
import string

# Load the model and vectorizer
model = load('spam_model.joblib')
vectorizer = load('tfidf_vectorizer.joblib')

def transform_text(text):
    text = text.lower()
    tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
    tokens = [token for token in tokens if token.isalnum()]
    tokens = [token for token in tokens if token not in stopwords.words('english')]
    stemmed_tokens = [PorterStemmer().stem(token) for token in tokens]
    return " ".join(stemmed_tokens)

sms_input = "Free vacation offer! Call now to claim your prize!"
processed_text = transform_text(sms_input)
vectorized_text = vectorizer.transform([processed_text])
prediction = model.predict(vectorized_text)

print("SPAM" if prediction == 1 else "HAM")
```

---

## **üìà Insights from the Data**  
- Spam messages are often longer and contain repeated phrases like "offer," "win," or "urgent."  
- Legitimate messages (ham) are shorter and often personalized.  
- Visualization tools like **Seaborn** helped reveal these patterns.
